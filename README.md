### The Last World (Steam)

[The Last World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1927520/The_Last_World/) is a sci-fi simulation game with elements of space, modding and automation in which the player has to discover new planets and terraform them.

![Start Image](images/1/store_capsule_vertical.png)

The world that we all knew and loved so well is dead. He was killed by a bacterium born in a test tube of a scientist who was trying to create a panacea - a cure for all diseases. The result is one - the disappearance of all life on the planet. On the verge of extinction, people created the "Ironborns" project - an artificial intelligence whose goal is to find a planet suitable for the existence of biological organisms in the endless ocean of stars and give a person a second chance to exist.

![Start Image](images/1/store_capsule_small.png)

The player will have to build and develop his base, explore, trade and much more. The game features a factory mechanic where the player can produce more expensive resources for sale or upgrades. The player will extract resources from the bowels of the planets and process them to obtain components that are more expensive to manufacture. [The Last World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1927520/The_Last_World/) is a sandbox where the player is free to choose his own path.
